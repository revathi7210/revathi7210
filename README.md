# 👋 Hi, I'm Revathi Bhat Anemajalu!

I'm a Master's student in Computer Engineering at UC Irvine, graduating in December 2025. I’m passionate about building efficient systems, diving deep into technical fundamentals, and working on projects that challenge my understanding of how things work under the hood.

## 🚀 Projects I'm Actively Working On

### 💸 Real-Time Expense & Subscription Tracker
**Tech Stack:** Python, Flask, InfluxDB, Grafana, Plaid API, Docker  
A full-stack personal finance tracker that processes live bank and card transaction data using Plaid.  
- Webhook-driven ingestion of real-time transaction streams  
- Subscription detection logic using merchant-frequency heuristics  
- Visual dashboards for categorized expenses & subscription timelines  
- Time-series storage with InfluxDB + Grafana dashboards  
- Dockerized deployment with webhook testing via Ngrok

### 🧬 **Cache Coherence Simulator for CXL Memory Systems**  
Researching software-based cache coherence protocols for parallel/distributed systems using Compute Express Link (CXL).  
- Focus on coarse-grained synchronization  
- Optimization of cacheline flushing at synchronization points  
- Exploring real-world applications in multithreaded C/C++ libraries like OpenBLAS and DataFrame processors

## 🛠️ Technical Toolkit

**Languages:** C, C++, Python, Java, Go (learning), Bash, SQL  
**Systems & Tools:**  
- OS concepts, thread scheduling, memory management  
- Docker, Jenkins, Git, InfluxDB, Grafana  
- Plaid API, Google Maps API, Calendar API, Todoist API  
- Flask, MySQL, HTML/CSS/JS, React  
- Debugging with `gdb`, `valgrind`, `perf`

## 🔧 Past Projects

- **🗓️ CalRoute – Intelligent Daily Planner**  
  Combines Google Calendar, Todoist, and Maps APIs to optimize task routing and scheduling in real time.  
  - Hybrid optimizer with TSP + time windows using OR-Tools  
  - LLM-based task parsing + scheduling via Flask backend & React frontend

- **📚 Adaptive E-Learning Platform**  
  Personalized quiz engine that adjusts question difficulty based on performance using rule-based logic.

- **🧵 Log-Structured File System (LogFS)**  
  Thread-safe file system in C with async disk writes and mutex-protected caching.

- **🧠 Storage Class Memory Manager**  
  A malloc-like persistent memory allocator using AVL trees and file-backed storage.

- **⚙️ Userspace Thread Scheduler**  
  POSIX-like thread APIs with cooperative context switching.

- **🔣 JIT Expression Evaluator**  
  Dynamically generates, compiles, and executes math expressions via shared libraries.
