# 👋 Hi, I'm Revathi Bhat Anemajalu!

I’m a backend and systems enthusiast currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at **UC Irvine**, graduating in December 2025.

## 💡 What I Care About

- Writing clean, performant code that scales
- Understanding *why* things work, not just *how*
- Building infrastructure that quietly powers the things we rely on
- Debugging low-level behavior and optimizing system performance

---

## 🧠 Interests

- Backend Engineering · Operating Systems · Compilers  
- Memory Management · Cache Coherence · Parallel & Distributed Systems  
- Building Deep Tech with Real-World Impact

---

## 🛠️ My Toolkit

**Languages**: C++, Python, Go (learning), Java, Bash  
**Tools & Frameworks**: Flask · Docker · Jenkins · Git · SQLAlchemy  
**Systems & Debugging**: Linux · `gdb` · `perf` · Valgrind · InfluxDB · Grafana  

I use tools that give me visibility into what's going on—and let me fix what isn’t.

## 🤝 Let's Connect

If you're into distributed systems, backend infrastructure, or just love chasing down tough bugs — I’d love to connect or collaborate.
